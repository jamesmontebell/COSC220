This program gives you a menu and gives the user several things they can do.
For one they can create a student, calling on the createStudent method to create a new student
and place said student in a double linked list either at the end or if the list is empty at the beginning. The student is
created with data based on user input.

For two they can delete a student, calling on the deleteStudent method to iterate through a double linked list of students
and finding a specific student that matches ID's with the user inputted ID. Then deleting that student by changing its next and previous
students to point around it, thus kicking it out of the list.

For three they can update a student, calling on the updateStudent method to iterate though a double linked list of students
and finding a specific student that mathces ID's withe the user inputted ID. Then it asks what information about the student would they
like to update.

For four the program prints the information about every single student in the list.

For Five the program prints the total number of students in the list.

For six the program calls on the addBook method letting the user create a book and assigning said book to a specific student.

For seven the program calls on the printBook method and prints every book in a specific students list.

For eight the program calls on the deleteBook method and deletes a specific students book based on the user inputted name.

Lastly for nine the program exits itself.
